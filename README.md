# List-Directory-File-Names (Completed/Working)
This is a simple script that creates a list of names for the files/folder within the same directory and outputs it to a text file. The name of the output text file is needed as a parameter. <br />
Note(s): <br />
The python script name itself is excluded. <br />
Possible improvement is to have the script run a recursive function to search through the folders within the main directory and return file/folder names. <br />
